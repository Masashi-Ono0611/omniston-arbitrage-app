This package provides binding for [omniston-sdk](https://github.com/ston-fi/omniston-sdk/tree/main/packages/omniston-sdk) to the React ecosystem. Using this package, you can access all Omniston methods as hooks powered by [TanStack react query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) (out-of-box loading states, retries, error handling, and match more)

You can find all supported methods in our [docs](https://docs.ston.fi/docs/developer-section/omniston) or take a look onto our [demo app](https://github.com/ston-fi/omniston-sdk/tree/main/examples/next-js-app) that use NextJs and `omniston-sdk-react` package
